# My Python Learning Journey 🐍

Welcome! This is where I'm storing my Python projects as I learn to code.

## Projects

### 1. Mad Libs Story Generator
A fun interactive word game that creates silly stories based on user input!
- **File:** `mad_libs.py`
  
**What it does:**
- Asks for 6 different inputs (weather, season, animal, adjective, verb, place)
- Creates a funny 2-sentence story using those words
- Decorated with emojis for a fun experience!

**Skills practiced:**
- Variables
- `input()` function
- F-strings for formatting
- Print statements
- Comments and code organization
- String multiplication for decoration
