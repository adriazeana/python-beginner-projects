# My Python Learning Journey 🐍

Welcome! I'm learning Python and documenting my progress here.

## Project(s)

### 1. Mad Libs Story Generator
A fun interactive word game that creates silly stories based on user input!
- **File:** `mad_libs.py`
  
**What it does:**
- Asks for 6 different inputs (weather, season, animal, adjective, verb, place)
- Creates a funny 4-sentence story using those words
- Decorated with emojis for a fun experience!

**Skills practiced:**
- Variables
- `input()` function
- F-strings for formatting
- Print statements
- Comments and code organization
- String multiplication for decoration

### 2. 🎮 Number Guessing Game
**File:** `guessing_game.py`
**Project URL:** https://roadmap.sh/projects/number-guessing-game

A CLI-based number guessing game where the computer picks a random number between 1-100 and you try to guess it!
  
## 🎯 What I've Learned So Far

- ✅ Variables and data types (int, float, str)
- ✅ User input with `input()`
- ✅ Functions and parameters
- ✅ F-strings for string formatting
- ✅ Comments with `#`
- ✅ Print statements
- ✅ Basic math operations
- ✅ String multiplication
- ✅ Code organization

**Features:**
- 3 difficulty levels (Easy: 10 chances, Medium: 5 chances, Hard: 3 chances)
- Random number generation
- Input validation (ensures valid numbers 1-100)
- Helpful hints after each guess (higher or lower)
- Attempt tracking and countdown
- Timer to track how long it takes to win
- Play multiple rounds without restarting
- Error handling for invalid inputs

**Skills practiced:**
- `import random` and `random.randint()`
- `import time` and `time.time()` for timing
- Functions with parameters and return values
- `while` loops (infinite and conditional)
- `if/elif/else` statements
- `try/except` error handling
- `break` to exit loops
- Input validation
- String methods (`.lower()`)
- Global variables and function scope

**How to run:**
```bash
python guessing_game.py
```

**Example gameplay:**
```
🎮 Welcome to the Number Guessing Game! 🎮
Please select difficulty: Medium (5 chances)

Enter your guess: 50
❌ Incorrect! The secret number is lower than 50.
Attempts remaining: 4

Enter your guess: 25
🎉 Congratulations! You guessed the correct number in 2 attempts.
⏱️  You finished the game in 15.23 seconds.

Do you want to play another round? (yes/no): yes
```
